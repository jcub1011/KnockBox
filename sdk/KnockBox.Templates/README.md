# KnockBox.Templates

**`dotnet new` template pack for KnockBox game plugins.**

Installs the `knockbox-game` template, which scaffolds a complete starter solution for a new KnockBox party-game plugin — plugin assembly, local dev host, and tests — in a single command.

## Install

```bash
dotnet new install KnockBox.Templates
```

## Use

```bash
dotnet new knockbox-game -n MyGame --routeIdentifier my-game
```

Parameters:

| Parameter | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `-n MyGame` | Project/solution name. Replaces `MyGame` across every generated file and folder. |
| `--routeIdentifier my-game` | URL-safe game identifier. Must be lowercase, hyphen-separated. Replaces `my-game` across every generated file, including each page's `@page` route. |

```

Every generated file carries inline comments explaining what it's for, which parts to edit, and which invariants to leave alone — so you can read the scaffold top-to-bottom and understand the shape of a plugin without leaving the IDE.

## Run it

```bash
cd MyGame
dotnet run --project MyGame.DevHost
```

Browse to the printed URL, click the tile, create a lobby, open a second browser (or incognito window) to join. Clicking **Start Game** runs your engine's `StartAsync` and transitions the lobby into gameplay.

## Next steps

- Add your game state fields to `MyGameGameState`, mutating them from inside `state.Execute(...)` blocks on the engine.
- Add command methods to `MyGameGameEngine` that return `Result` / `ValueResult<T>`.
- Render the in-game UI in `MyGameLobby.razor` by branching on `GameState.IsJoinable` (or a phase enum you add yourself).
- Run `dotnet test` to exercise your engine against a real state with logger mocks.

## Notes for template maintainers

The `routeIdentifier` symbol in `.template.config/template.json` uses `"replaces": "my-game"`, which substitutes **every literal occurrence** of `my-game` across the scaffold — including comments and XML-doc examples. Do not introduce illustrative `my-game` strings anywhere in the template that are meant to remain literal after scaffolding (they won't). Same caution applies to `MyGame`, which is substituted by the `-n` name parameter.
